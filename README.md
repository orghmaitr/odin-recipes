## Self Reflections
- Firstly, I incorporated the HTML boilerplate which included the following elements: declaring the doctype, specifying meta-information, setting UTF-8 encoding, giving a title, and displaying content. I also utilized several other elements, such as, headings, paragraphs, bold, italicized, lists, links, and images.
- Secondly, I learned how to ask technical questions, the basics of a computer, how the web works, the basics of command line, Git and GitHub fundamentals, how to write great atomic commit messages, and how to view projects on the web via GitHub Pages.
- Next, I stylized all the webpages with the following CSS selector types: universal selector, type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, grouping selectors, chaining selectors, and descendant combinators. I also used CSS properties like background-color, color, font-family, font-size, font-weight, text-align, image height and width. More importantly, I made sure to follow the rules of the CSS cascade, namely, specificity, inheritance, and rule order.
- Lastly, I utilized the newly learned standard and alternative CSS box model to change the look and feel of the entire recipe website.
