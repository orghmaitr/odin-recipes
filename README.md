# odin-recipes
A Basic Recipe Website ([Live Preview](https://orghmaitr.github.io/odin-recipes/))

## Status
***This project is being actively worked upon.***

## Description
**odin-recipes** is the [first project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) from the [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) in the [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about).

This is a basic recipe website which consists of a main index page with links to three recipes. This project is just to build some HTML chops; therefore, it won't look pretty unless you're into brutalist web design.

## Technologies
- **Git**
- **HTML**
- **GitHub Pages**

## Improvements
- [ ] Style it up with CSS

## Self Reflections
- This is the first time I've dealt with web development. It was quite a fun experience.
- I incorporated the HTML boilerplate which included the following elements: declaring the doctype, specifying meta-information using head, setting UTF-8 encoding using charset, giving a title, and displaying content using body. I utilized several other elements, such as, headings, paragraphs, bold, italicized, lists, links, and images.
- More importantly, I learned the following: how to ask technical questions, computer basics, how the web works, command line basics, Git and GitHub fundamentals, how to write great atomic commit messages, and viewing project on the web via GitHub Pages. 

## Acknowledgements
- This README is inspired by [ritaly's README cheatsheet](https://github.com/ritaly/README-cheatsheet).
- The three recipes, i.e., the name, images, description, ingredients, and steps of the each recipe, were directly taken from [allrecipes](https://www.allrecipes.com/) and [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/).
