## Self Reflections
- This is the first time I've dealt with web development. It was quite a fun experience.
- I incorporated the HTML boilerplate which included the following elements: declaring the doctype, specifying meta-information using head, setting UTF-8 encoding using charset, giving a title, and displaying content using body. I utilized several other elements, such as, headings, paragraphs, bold, italicized, lists, links, and images.
- I learned the following: how to ask technical questions, computer basics, how the web works, command line basics, Git and GitHub fundamentals, how to write great atomic commit messages, and viewing project on the web via GitHub Pages.
- I stylized all the webpages with the following CSS selector types: universal selector, type selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, grouping selectors, chaining selectors, and descendant combinators. I also used the following CSS properties: background-color, color, font-family, font-size, font-weight, text-align, image height and width. I made sure to follow the cascade rules, namely, specificity, inheritance, and rule order.
- I utilized the newly learned standard and alternative CSS box model to change the look and feel of the entire recipe website.
