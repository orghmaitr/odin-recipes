    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Char siu</strong> is Chinese restaurant-style pork with a deep red, sweet and sticky coating. Char siu literally means "fork roast" and refers to the traditional method of cooking this dish by which strips of seasoned pork were skewered with long forks and roasted in a covered oven or over a fire.</p>
    <p>Originating in Guangdong, it is eaten with rice, used as an ingredient for noodle dishes or in stir fries, and as a filling for chasiu baau or pineapple buns. <em>Five-spice powder is the primary spice, honey or other sweeteners are used as a glaze</em>, and the characteristic red color comes from the red yeast rice when made traditionally.</p>
