    <p><strong>Oyakodon</strong> is a delicious traditional Japanese meal consisting of chicken saut√©ed and then cooked in a Japanese broth, and then finished with egg and served over rice. It's really easy, filling, and delicious.</p>
    <p><em>Oyakodon, literally "parent-and-child donburi", is a donburi, or Japanese rice bowl dish, in which chicken, egg, sliced scallion (or sometimes regular onions)</em>, and other ingredients are all simmered together in a kind of soup that is made with soy sauce and stock, and then served on top of a large bowl of rice.</p>
