      <div class="text-container">
        <p><strong>Sinigang</strong> is a Filipino soup or stew characterized by its sour and savory taste. It is most often associated with tamarind (Filipino: sampalok), although it can use other sour fruits and leaves as the souring agent. It is one of the more popular dishes in Filipino cuisine.</p>
        <p>The soup is usually accompanied by rice. <em>In 2021, sinigang was rated as the world's best vegetable soup by TasteAtlas</em>. In December 2023, the website project's TasteAtlas Awards 2023/24 included sinigang among its "100 best dishes in the world".</p>
